Storyline: Beginning cutscnene: -Pupil (the Player) wishes to visit Sensei
                                 in the middle of the night for extra training
                                -Pupil says "Sensei, I have trained with you
                                 for many years, but I still don't think I'm
                                 good enough!"
                                -Suddenly, a member of the Fruit Society comes
                                 and kidnaps Sensei
                                -Leaves a note saying "If you want to save
                                 Sensei, come to the warehouse"
           Display table: Rules, Hall of Ninjas, Quit
           *Under rules: Arcade Mode, Classic Mode*
           Before First Classic Mode: -Fruit Society guy says "I see you're
                                       doing pretty well. Let me try this new
                                       tactic!"
           Before Final Level: -Fruit Society guy says "*gasp* *gasp* You'll
                                never save Sensei! There's no way you can
                                [bold] cut this pomegranate at least 40
                                times! [bold]"
           If player does not succeed: -Fruit Society Member says "Hah! I knew
                                        you couldn't do it! You have bought
                                        me some time to prepare more fruits!"
           Ending Cutscene: -Sensei is freed from the pomegranate
                            -Sensei says "Thank you for saving me. Throughout
                             this excitement, you have improved and learned
                             much, my pupil. I have seen that you will not
                             need my training anymore. I hereby pronouce you
                             a Ninja Elite!"

           *Enter your name into the Hall of Ninjas*
